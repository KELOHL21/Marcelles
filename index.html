      <h1 class="dermadry_header">Dermadry Treament</h1>
      <p>DermaDry is a device that uses iontophoresis with tap water to cure excessive sweating. Iontophoresis has an extremely high success rate in obtaining total dryness, unlike creams and antiperspirants. It's non-invasive, drug- and needle-free method of treating excessive sweating. Treatments with Iontophoresis only take 15 to 20 minutes, and the effects can last up to 6 weeks.</p>

            <h1>Hyperhidrosis (Excessive Sweating)</h1>

            <p>
               4.8%1 of the population suffers from hyperhidrosis, a medical disorder characterized by excessive perspiration. The amount of sweat produced by those with the illness is typically four to five times greater than that required to maintain normal body temperature.
            </p>

               The disorder is associated with a worse quality of life and may have an adverse impact on a person's social, occupational, physical, and emotional well-being. It is frequently referred to as "the silent disability" because many people suffer in silence due to lack of knowledge and shame fears.

            <h1>Iontophoresis</h1>

            <p class="intro">
               Iontophoresis is one of the few cases where mixing water and electricity is advised since it uses tap water and electrical current to momentarily cease sweating.
            </p>

            <div class="sol_img">

               <p class="solu">
                  Treating mild to severe cases of hyperhidrosis using iontophoresis is risk-free and efficient. The Iontophoresis device is connected to a power source that uses tap water's minerals as a conductor to give a mild electrical current to the treatment area. The conductive metal electrodes allow the electricity to pass through to the skin, which is slightly wet. To protect the skin during treatment, ensure proper comfort, and even treat the entire zone, a barrier such as a cloth or sponge is placed over the electrodes. The concentration, size, hydrophilicity, lipophilicity, and polarity of molecules, as well as physical, biological, and chemical factors like current or skin factors, all affect transport. Sweating stops in the treated area because of the modest electrical current's disruption of the signal between the nerves and sweat glands. Even the most severe instances of Hyperhidrosis can be treated with great success even though the exact mechanism of action is still unknown.
